Ja Vai Tarde
==================

This is a twitter agent used by @JaVaiTarde. It's an "unfollows monitor".

Users interested in this feature have to follow @JaVaiTarde. This robot will
monitor their list of followers. If somebody stops following them, @JaVaiTarde
sends them a direct message telling them so.

It runs every 8 hours and respects Twitter's rate limiting, pausing the
execution when the quota depletes, resuming only when the quota is reset.
